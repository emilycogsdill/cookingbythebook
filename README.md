It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake

## the heck is this

I was ambiguously unemployed for a bit ("independently working" as my mother likes to call it) so I put my shoulder to the wheel and figured out how Flask works. 

I was looking for a way to upgrade from my previous method of recipe tracking, which generally involved asking Greg to take some notes in a text doc. However, I am too much of a boomer to download a "mobile app" or some such. The obvious solution was to develop a web app. And here it is for all of you to see. 

The app is live here: https://cookingbythebook.herokuapp.com/
