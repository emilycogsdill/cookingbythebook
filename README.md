It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake

## the heck is this

I was ambiguously unemployed for a bit ("independently working" as my mother likes to call it) so I put my shoulder to the wheel and figured out how Flask works. I was looking for a way to upgrade from my previous method of recipe tracking, which generally involved asking Greg to take some notes in a text doc. But I am too much of a boomer to download a "mobile app" or some such.

So, the obvious solution was to develop a web app. And here it is for all of you to see. Look, I'm just a data engineer, and I probably have other things I should be doing right now - is it too much to ask that you just be proud of me?

The app is live here: https://cookingbythebook.herokuapp.com/

Or, if you prefer, the bleeding edge of what's currently in development (she said, as though this is actually a thing): https://cookingbythebook-dev.herokuapp.com/
